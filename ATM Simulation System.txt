                             ATM Simulation System
                        ==================================
This Java project implements a command-line ATM simulation system with extensible card support.
Users can insert different ATM cards (e.g., HDFC, SBI, Kotak) to perform various
banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and mini statement.


Project Structure:
==================

ATMMachine.java:    The main class orchestrating the ATM simulation. It dynamically loads and instantiates ATM card classes 
---------------      based on user input, providing a menu-driven interface for banking operations.

BankAccount.java:  Represents a simple bank account with deposit, withdrawal, and balance functionalities. 
-----------------    It is utilized by specific ATM card implementations.

ATMCard.java: An interface defining the standard ATM card operations - deposit, withdraw, and check current balance.
-------------

--> HDFCBankCard.java, SBIBankCard.java, KotakBankCard.java: Concrete implementations of the ATMCard interface, representing HDFC, SBI, and Kotak bank cards, respectively.

--> InsufficientFundsException.java, InvalidAmountException.java: Custom exception classes for handling insufficient funds and invalid amount scenarios.

How to Use:
============
1.Clone the repository.
2.Compile all Java files.
3.Run the ATMMachine class.
4.Follow the on-screen instructions to insert a card, choose an option, and perform banking operations.
